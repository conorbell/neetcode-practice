The two pointer technique is a means of a traversing an array(often sorted, but depending on the challenge it doesn't have to be!) or a linked list

There are two types of two pointer techniques
1. Left and right - starting on opposite ends of your list 
2. fast and slow(tortoise and the hare) - one pointer moves at a slower pace while the other moves twice as fast
